# k8s_01

A container that will read mounted container logfiles, then enriches them using Kubernetes API server, and forwards them with RELP to wanted target server.

It uses KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST and KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT environment variables to connect to the Kubernetes API.

## Example Helm Chart usage

See `k8s_01/` directory for more information

## Overriding configurations with environment variables

Currently supported:

 - `K8S_01_RELP_TARGET` overwrites `.relp.target`

 - `K8S_01_RELP_PORT` overwrites `.relp.port`

## Example test cluster usage

You can find example cluster in `/example` directory
